For two years, I ran BAR 133, a student pub where people could grab a beer and decompress after staring at equations or data all day. It was equal parts chaos and funâ€”think pouring drinks, organizing events, keeping everything running smoothly, and occasionally dealing with the inevitable weirdness that comes with running a bar.

Turns out, managing a pub isn't that different from managing research projects. You learn to juggle a million things at once, work with a team, solve problems on the fly, and keep people happy.
