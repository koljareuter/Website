I am a Master's student in Physics at the Ruprecht-Karls University Heidelberg, focusing on galaxy evolution and AGN feedback.  
My research focusses on observational spectroscopy and tries to investigate the interplay between AGNs and galaxy evolution. To achieve this goal i have worked with the MaNGA-, as well as the KMOS3D-Sample and combined in depth-studies of single galaxies, as well as statistical approaches of hundreds of galaxies.
